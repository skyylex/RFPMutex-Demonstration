# RFPMutex-Demonstration

Current demo is a try to build some logic control unit to synchronize UI actions using stateless RFP approach with ReactiveCocoa 2.0. Made it just for fun. I'd not personally use such approach blindly.

This app was made as accompaniment to [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33106548/how-to-make-mutex-signals-with-reactivecocoa/33168026#33168026).

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or suggestions.
